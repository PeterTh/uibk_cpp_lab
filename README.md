# Advanced C++ Programming - Practical Part

This repository contains practical exercises to accompany [the lecture](https://github.com/PeterTh/uibk_cpp).
Based on Material by Alex Hirsch.

## Grading

Grading for the entire module is based on 

1. An exam covering the lecture.
2. Completion of [the assignment](assignment).
3. Weekly participation in the presentation of assignment progress, and its discussion.

## Exercises

These exercises support the lecture and explore certain auxiliary topics relevant to C++.
You are encouraged to solve (or at least think about) these exercises.  
You will not submit a solution as these exercises are optional, but feel free to ask questions when running into problems.
